            Hello! My name is Preston, and I'm a junior here at FAU, majoring in Computer Science. In my free time, I usually just play video games (I'm a fan of the Switch), and occasionally practice my piano. Below is a portion of my recently-played game catalog.<br>

            <br>
            I'm a member of Project Group 12, but at this point in time, the team is too new for roles to really be established. However, so far I've managed the overall organization of the team by creating a Trello board for task management and our GitHub repo for project organization. <br>
            <br>
            Besides CEN4010, I'm also taking CAP4630, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, as an elective. I'm enjoying both classes so far, and am looking forward to working with my team further in this class. <br>
