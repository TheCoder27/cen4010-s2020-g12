Language Glossary:
echo - basic print statement for php to write contents. When executed from a file on a web server, it embeds the
contents on the page. 

ob_start - This function will turn output buffering on. While output buffering is active no output is sent from the
script (other than headers), instead the output is stored in an internal buffer. The contents of this internal 
buffer may be copied into a string variable using ob_get_contents(). To output what is stored in the internal 
buffer, use ob_end_flush(). Alternatively, ob_end_clean() will silently discard the buffer contents.

Files:
chat_form.php - Creates a post form. onsubmit it calls addChatS targeting this form. It then creates a div
encapsulating the form. It uses php to create an input, and saves a reference to the input as chatrooms[0].
